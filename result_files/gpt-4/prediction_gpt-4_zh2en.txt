1	The transition to parenthood is one of the most stressful adjustments facing new parents, both in terms of personal identity and relationships with others.
2	Studies addressing the bidirectional associations between intergenerational relationships during this transitional period are very limited, and the complexity of the interrelationships varies depending on the residential living situation.
3	This study aimed to explore (1) the bidirectional association between the transition to parenthood, the couple's marital relationship, and conflict with each other's parents, and (2) the moderating effect of living with fathers on the above relationships.
4	The subjects of this study were 359 married mothers, using a three-wave prospective long-term study design.
5	The Dyadic Adjustment Scale and the Streck Adjustment Inventory Scale were used to assess marital relationships and conflict relationships with each other's parents.
6	When examining interrelationships, cross time lag plane analysis was used, and multigroup analysis was used when determining whether these relationships exhibited different patterns with different life situations.
7	Two cross-lagged panel models demonstrate a bidirectional relationship between marital problems and conflicts with each other's parents during mid to late pregnancy.
8	Meanwhile, multi-cohort analysis indicated that intra-marital problems were induced by conflicts with opposite parents in the group of subjects who lived with their parents during pregnancy; whereas in the group of subjects not living with their parents, a conflict in the relationship with each other's father from late pregnancy to the postpartum period may have exacerbated marital problems.
9	These research findings reveal a cross-time lag association for intergenerational conflict.
10	Healthcare professionals are warranted to ensure that intergenerational relationships are positively advantageous during the transition to parenthood.
11	This study enhances our understanding of the impact of co-residing with fathers on marital relationships and can guide the future development of culturally-based multi-dimensional intervention approaches.
12	Linear regression models are widely used in mental health and health services related research.
13	However, classical linear regression analysis assumes that the data are normally distributed, but the data obtained from many studies do not meet this assumption.
14	One of the ways to solve this problem is to adopt a semiparametric model that does not require the data to be normally distributed.
15	However, semiparametric models are fairly sensitive to discrete data, and the resulting estimates are unreliable when dealing with data containing discrete values.
16	In this case, some investigators perform analyses after these extreme values are censored; however, the ad-hoc rules for censoring data are based on subjective criteria, so different methods of adjustment produce different results.
17	Hierarchical regression offers a more objective approach for handling data that is not normally distributed, including discrete values.
18	This paper uses both virtual and actual data to demonstrate this very useful regression method for handling discrete values and compares it with results obtained by using classical and semiparametric regression models.
19	The outcomes of relationship education (RE) interventions have been both positive and negative for low-income partners.
20	It is not clear which aspects of the item model acted to positively facilitate change for partners who experienced positive changes.
21	Many low-income couples participate in government-funded relationship education programs while access to and utilization of resources, such as social and community support, are limited.
22	Item models often provide relevant resources to complement specific skill training in relationship education.
23	This paper examines the relationship among income, social support, and family function, and also explores the mediating role of social support in family functional outcomes.
24	Study subjects were 856 low-income partners from a multiethnic group attending relationship education.
25	Analyses included three separate binary models for studying the association between the relevant elements at baseline, and also included the outcome of the immediate follow-up relational education intervention.
26	The results show that the relationship between social support and family functioning reported by the participants is manifested in: (a) a correlation between social support and baseline family functioning for both men and women, (b) Male baseline social support was influenced by female baseline family functioning, (c) The social support change scores for men and women had a positive effect on their own family functioning change scores.
27	However, social support did not significantly moderate the change in family function.
28	The implementation of relationship education and related research are discussed in the research revelation section.
29	The constitution of risk genes in signaling pathways may potentially explain the synergistic neurobiological effects of alcohol dependence risk genes.
30	Identification of risk genes and risk gene pathways for alcohol dependence.
31	We conducted a pathway-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) for alcohol dependence using gene set enrichment analysis.
32	Nearly one million genetic markers were examined in an exploratory sample population comprising 1409 European American (EA) alcohol dependent individuals and 1518 EA healthy controls.
33	Additionally, 681 African American (AA) cases and 508 AA healthy subjects were included as test-retest samples.
34	We identified several reproducible genome-wide risk genes and risk pathways significantly associated with alcohol dependence.
35	After Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, the "cell extracellular matrix interaction" pathways (some genes and biological signaling processes) may be associated with the risk of alcohol dependence in European American samples, and the findings of the present study provide novel evidence for this.
36	A total of 26 patients with acute lung injury due to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimens were analyzed. The clinical characteristics, treatment, and prognosis of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who developed acute lung injury after treatment with rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimens were summarized to improve understanding and guide clinical management.
37	A total of 26 DLBCL patients treated in our institution from January 2013 to September 2018 with a rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimen and presenting with acute lung injury were selected for the analysis of clinical features, imaging findings, chemotherapy course, treatment efficacy, and prognosis.
38	The main clinical symptoms of the patient were fever, cough, and chest tightness; twelve of these patients had hypoxemia, and three had type I respiratory failure; a chest CT revealed diffuse ground glass opacity in both lungs as the primary finding, with some patients also showing a small amount of pleural effusion; the onset time primarily spanned 2-4 episodes, with symptom onset occurring 8-49 days after rituximab infusion per the protocol; 25 patients experienced no significant limitations in daily life following effective treatment, and 1 patient died after treatment was ineffective.
39	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma shows no typical clinical symptoms in the early stages of acute lung injury following the use of rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimens, and early detection along with early hormone therapy are crucial for achieving good therapeutic outcomes.
40	To explore non-genetic factors that influence overall survival in patients with multiple myeloma (MM).
41	The clinical data of 51 multiple myeloma patients with complete follow-up data who visited the Department of Hematology at Nanjing Medical University Affiliated Jiangning Hospital between November 2011 and October 2019 were retrospectively reviewed.
42	The non-genetic influencing factors were analyzed, and the overall survival time was used as the standard for prognosis evaluation.
43	Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and factors associated with prognosis were analyzed by univariate analysis using the log-rank test and multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model.
44	Of the 51 patients, consisting of 29 males and 22 females, 21 died and 30 were still alive from follow-up until December 2019.
45	Univariate analysis showed that patient age, disease stage, standard treatment, use of new drugs, maintenance therapy, hypercalcemia, globulin, albumin, and hemoglobin were associated with overall survival time in patients younger than 65 years, ISS stages I and II, standard treatment, use of new drugs, normal or subnormal serum calcium. Patients with normal or subnormal globulin levels and albumin ≥ 35 g/L or hemoglobin ≥ 100 g/L had significantly longer overall survival (P < 0.05).
46	Multivariate analysis showed that maintenance therapy, serum calcium ≥ 2.6 mmol/L, and hemoglobin < 100 g/L were independent risk factors for MM prognosis.
47	Patients with serum calcium ≥ 2.6 mmol/L, hemoglobin < 100 g/L, and no regular maintenance therapy had a poor prognosis.

51	Chemical eye injury (CEI) is a severe vision- and life-threatening emergency that usually occurs at home or in the workplace, with the former generally milder, the latter more severe, and involving both eyes.
52	Serious work-related unintentional injuries also involve injuries at other body sites, possibly related to inhalation or ingestion of chemicals.
53	Alkali burns lead to a saponification reaction in the tissue and deeply penetrate the tissue.
54	Acid damage causes rapid tissue clotting, impedes infiltration, and limits damage.
55	Irritant substances, such as alcohol, can cause superficial epithelial denudation.
56	Severe chemical damage can affect the entire anterior segment structures, resulting in abnormalities of the iris, pupil, and lens.
57	IOP is variably affected and may decrease, increase, or rapidly change from one IOP situation at the beginning to another.
58	Chorioretinal vasculopathy is believed to be secondary to inflammation of the anterior segment, not due to the direct effect of CEI.
59	The final outcome in relation to structure and function depends on the causative agent, the time of exposure, the means of treatment, and the speed of its intervention.
60	After determining the pH value in both eyes, it is key to prevent further damage by extensive and prolonged ocular irrigation, as well as to search for and clear all particulate matter.
61	Other treatment principles include thorough eye assessment, inflammation control, promotion of healing, and prevention and management of sequelae and complications.
62	Intraocular pressure is easily overlooked, but it must be assessed and managed.
63	Management often requires multidisciplinary collaboration.
64	Pyroptosis is a caspase (caspase-1/4/5/11)-dependent programmed cell death modality primarily characterized by inflammasome activation, cell membrane rupture, pore formation, and release of cellular contents.
65	As a novel form of cell death, pyroptosis is extensively involved in respiratory diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis, acute lung injury/respiratory distress syndrome, bronchial dysplasia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma.
66	This review focuses on the mechanism of pyroptosis and its role in various respiratory diseases, aiming to provide new insights for the treatment of respiratory diseases.
67	To explore and analyze risk factors for the development of herpes zoster during bortezomib chemotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma (MM).
68	Clinical data of 85 multiple myeloma patients treated with bortezomib-based chemotherapy regimens at Gansu Provincial People's Hospital from January 2015 to January 2019 were collected and divided into case and control groups according to whether herpes zoster occurred.
69	Clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome, and risk factors for developing herpes zoster were reviewed.
70	Of the 85 MM patients treated with bortezomib-based chemotherapy, 20 developed herpes zoster, with an incidence rate of approximately 23.5%.
71	In univariate analysis, age ≥ 65 years, pretreatment lymphopenia, pretreatment neutropenia, ECoG score ≥ 2, use of cyclophosphamide, and no prophylactic antiviral treatment given were associated with the development of herpes zoster (P < 0.05).
72	Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that pretreatment lymphopenia, the use of cyclophosphamide, and no prophylactic antiviral treatment were independent risk factors for the development of herpes zoster (P < 0.05).
73	MM patients have a high incidence of herpes zoster; pre-treatment lymphopenia, usage of cyclophosphamide, and failure to administer prophylactic antiviral therapy are significant risk factors for developing herpes zoster and must be considered by clinicians.
74	Clinical-experimental characteristics of adult patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and analysis of factors influencing prognosis: Observational analysis of the clinical-experimental characteristics and prognostic factors in adult patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) who presented to our institution between January 2010 and August 2019 with histopathologically confirmed adult LCH (38 cases) were evaluated. The clinical outcomes of the patients were analyzed in depth. Thirty-eight patients with LCH had a median age of 41 (range 21-65) years and a male to female ratio of approximately 2:1.
75	Of the 38 patients with LCH, 44.7% presented with multisystem involvement, 31.6% had involvement of organs at risk (liver, lung, hematopoietic system, or spleen), the most commonly affected organ was the bone (21/38, 55.3%), and the most common clinical symptom was pain (19/38, 50.0%).
76	Laboratory tests showed that the incidences of anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, monocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), as well as elevated ferritin, were 10.5%, 2.6%, 5.3%, 15.8%, 28.9%, 28.6% (6/21), 55.3% (10/18), and 55.3% (9/17), respectively.
77	The median follow-up was 53 months, and a total of five patients died.
78	The 10-year overall survival (OS) rate for patients with single system involvement was 100%, which was significantly better than that for patients with multiple system involvement (70.1%) (P = 0.0078).
79	Patients without risk organ involvement had a significantly better prognosis than those with risk organ involvement, with 10-year OS rates of 100% and 60.6%, respectively (P = 0.0007).
80	Further analysis revealed that, in addition to multisystem involvement with at-risk organ involvement as poor prognostic factors, increased peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as well as elevated ferritin at initial diagnosis were significantly associated with a worse prognosis. In adult Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) patients, multisystem involvement with at-risk organ involvement, increased PBMCs at initial diagnosis, and elevated ferritin were significant poor prognostic factors.
81	The degree of endorsement of a relationship from one's social network has been predictive of the outcome of that relationship.
82	There is also some research suggesting that attachment behaviors buffer the negative effects of various factors, such as depression, on interpersonal relationships.
83	The current study sample included 858 married couples, and we used an actor-partner interdependence model within the framework of SEM to explore the effect of disagreement from the aspects of parents and friends on the quality of one's own and one's partner's marital relationships.
84	We also examined whether each spouse's attachment behavior was able to slow these effects.
85	The results suggest that one's own attachment behavior, regardless of gender, moderates the effect of parental and friend disagreement on their self-reported relationship quality.
86	Partner attachment behavior moderated the effect of own friends' disagreement on men's and women's self-reported relationship quality; in addition, the major effects resulting from the disagreement of the partner's parents and friends played little role in this test.
87	This finding supports the conclusion that there is a buffering effect on partner attachment behavior, i.e., a role in mitigating the negative impacts of disagreements with social network members on partner relationship outcomes.
88	Clinical implications are discussed.
89	Clinical practice guidelines, such as those focused on traumatic stress treatment, can play an important role in promoting inclusion and equity.
90	Based on a review of 14 international trauma treatment guidance documents that explicitly mention children, we reflect on two areas where these guidelines can become more inclusive and equitable: a) the incorporation of a child's cultural background, and b) the opportunity for the child to express his or her voice.
91	Although several guidelines mention that treatment should be tailored to the cultural needs of the child, there is little guidance on how this can be achieved.
92	Moreover, there still appears to be a strong Western bias at all stages of generating and evaluating the international evidence base.
93	Existing guidelines also mean that youth under the age of 18 years are not consulted during guideline development.
94	To promote inclusion and equity, we suggest five elements for future national guideline development efforts.
95	Promoting research and developing guidelines for currently underrepresented groups should be a high priority in our field.
96	Our national, regional, and global professional societies have the advantage of continuing to facilitate dialogue and action in this area.
97	Perioperative blood management (PBM) for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) is summarized.
98	To thoroughly review and summarize the progress of PBM strategies for TKA and THA both domestically and internationally, and incorporating the clinical experience of West China Hospital of Sichuan University, the analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of various strategies were evaluated from three aspects: optimizing hematopoiesis, minimizing blood loss and transfusions, which could provide a foundation for clinical selection.
99	There are many patient blood management (PBM) methods for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA), among which optimizing hematopoiesis mainly includes the use of perioperative iron and erythropoietin. Measures to reduce bleeding include the use of a tourniquet, controlled hypotension during surgery, and perioperative administration of antifibrinolytic agents. Autotransfusion primarily includes preoperative autotransfusion, autotransfusion with hemodilution, and intraoperative autologous blood reinfusion. Allogeneic blood transfusion is the ultimate treatment for anemia.
100	The use of erythropoietin combined with iron therapy for blood mobilization before surgery, along with intraoperative controlled hypotension for bleeding control, and the use of multimodal tranexamic acid can achieve satisfactory results.
101	During the perioperative period of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA), the selection between single or multiple blood management strategies should be tailored to the patients' physical and economic conditions to minimize blood loss, reduce the necessity for allogeneic blood transfusions, and hasten postoperative recovery.
102	To compare the clinical efficacy of bone-filling mesh vertebroplasty (vesselplasty) and percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) in the treatment of Kümmell's disease.
103	From January 2015 to December 2018, 63 patients with Kümmell's disease were studied, of which 28 were treated with vesselplasty (vesselplasty group) and 35 with percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP group).
104	General data including gender, age, disease duration, t-value of BMD, fractured segment, preoperative pain visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), height of the injured vertebral front, and kyphotic Cobb angle were compared between the two groups (all patients were followed from 12 to 36 months, averaging 24.2 months).
105	The operation time, intraoperative fluoroscopy time, cement injection volume, and cement diffusion area ratio in the vesselplasty group were significantly smaller than those in the PKP group (both vesselplasty and PKP treated Kümmell's disease with similar efficacy, effectively relieving patients' pain symptoms, improving quality of life, partially restoring injured vertebral height, and correcting vertebral body kyphosis).
106	However, the former has some advantages such as shorter operation time, less intraoperative fluoroscopy time, and less cement leakage.
107	This systematic review examines the effect of post-immigration variables on the mental health of European asylum seekers and refugee populations.
108	It mainly focuses on the effects of post-migratory stressors (including duration and type of stay in sheltered procedures, residential status, and social integration) and their impact on post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression.
109	This review examined twenty-two studies.
110	In 9 of the 22 studies, the duration of sheltered employment and length of stay were identified as the most frequently mentioned factors associated with mental health challenges.
111	Seven studies reported significant associations between risk factors and mental health, and were moderated by residential status.
112	Instead, the impact of legal status is more complexly linked to other post-immigration factors.
113	It was found to serve as a marker for other post-immigration variables including loneliness, discrimination, communication or language problems.
114	Family-related difficulties were also found to be associated with the length of stay and legal status, while other post-immigration factors such as residence and length of stay had a greater impact on mental health.
115	The discovery of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) has provided a scientific basis for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB).
116	The widespread availability of the neonatal hepatitis B vaccine has significantly lowered the prevalence of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in our population, and antiviral treatments based on interferon and/or nucleos(t)ide analogues can effectively suppress HBV replication, ameliorate hepatic inflammatory necrosis and fibrosis, thereby reducing the incidence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
117	However, it is difficult for current treatments to achieve the goal of clinical cure for HBsAg negativity.
118	In recent years, direct antiviral drugs targeting the HBV life cycle and immunomodulatory drugs targeting the body's antiviral response have entered active development.
119	A well-designed and executed protocol that is correctly analyzed and properly interpreted is key to determining whether new drugs for the clinical cure of hepatitis B can be successfully developed.
120	It is hoped that experts in Hepatology, clinical pharmacology, and methodology will collaborate to advance the development of new drugs for the clinical cure of hepatitis B by employing new clinical trial designs, novel endpoints, novel data management, and quality control techniques.
121	To compare the efficacy of suture fixation and anchor fixation in the repair of lateral collateral ligament complex (LCLC) injuries in the terrible triad of the elbow.
122	A total of 50 patients with the terrible triad of the elbow were retrospectively reviewed from June 2012 to January 2018. Among them, 22 patients were treated with anchor fixation (anchor group) and 28 patients were treated with transosseous tunnel suture fixation (transosseous tunnel group) to repair the lateral collateral ligament complex (LCLC).
123	There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of sex, age, side of fracture, time from injury to admission, or general data regarding the triad of coronal synostosis, radial head fracture, and elbow phobia (when the triad of elbow phobia was successfully treated), operative time, and intraoperative blood loss. The repair of LCLC using either bone tunnel fixation or anchor fixation can achieve satisfactory outcomes.
124	To analyze the efficacy of rituximab combined with CHOP/EPOCH regimen in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and to investigate the high-risk factors for refractory relapsed patients, 72 patients with primary DLBCL treated at the Department of Hematology, Peking University Hospital, Southeast China from December 2012 to December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed to analyze the response rate of DLBCL patients treated with rituximab and chemotherapy in combination with CHOP/EPOCH regimen.
125	At the same time, survival analysis was conducted to explore the high-risk factors influencing refractory relapse. Among these patients, 45 achieved complete remission (CR) and 11 achieved partial remission (PR), resulting in an overall remission rate of 77.78%, which includes 25 patients with refractory relapse and a relapse rate of 34.2%.
126	On univariate analysis, B symptoms, low hemoglobin level, high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, low lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, and the combination of rituximab with CHOP/EPOCH regimen resulted in a high remission rate in DLBCL, but about one-third of patients still experienced refractory relapse.
127	B symptoms, low hemoglobin, high beta
128	Common surgical approaches for hip arthroscopy in treating acetabular labrum injuries are reviewed to provide references for clinical management.
129	The recent literature on surgical methods and clinical outcomes of hip arthroscopic treatment for acetabular labrum injuries, both domestically and internationally, was reviewed, analyzed, and summarized.
130	Early in the development of hip arthroscopy, debridement of the torn labrum was the primary treatment option.
131	Current treatment principles dictate the surgical approach based on the degree of labrum tear and include acetabular labrum debridement, acetabular labrum repair, acetabular labrum reconstruction, and acetabular labrum reinforcement.
132	Hip arthroscopy has become the mainstay technique for the treatment of labrum injuries, and acetabular labrum repair should be preferred when conditions permit, followed by acetabular labrum reconstruction when the labrum is irreparable.
133	A systems approach to studying family and health should embrace a complex network in which family members are intertwined and that incorporates multiple family relationships and a larger health care system.
134	However, much of the research related to family and health that focuses on adult family members concentrates solely on intimacy, namely marital relationships.
135	There are many other relationships that have been overlooked due to the strong family ties maintained by adults, who increasingly value intimacy as they age.
136	In this systematic review of familial and adult health-related literature, 72 articles were screened and thematically decoded in sequence, identifying major core themes in this field.
137	The results indicated that there were six major themes, which included: the quality of family relationships, family structure, behavioral factors in terms of health and health care, psychophysical adjustment factors, caregiving situations, and elderly health.
138	Findings support that less represented family members contribute more to studies of adult health than just close partners alone.
139	Prolonged intake of large amounts of ethanol leads to intestinally derived endotoxemia, reactive oxygen species, high concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and uric acid activating the pyroptosis system, which in turn leads to hepatocyte death by cleavage of the gasdermin-d punch mechanism, accompanied by the release of inflammatory factors such as interleukin-1 β and interleukin-18.
140	This series of processes activates the immune system, which mediates a cascade of inflammatory responses and promotes the progression of alcoholic liver disease from steatosis to inflammation and fibrosis.
141	Family-level conflict and family cohesion are well-established measures of adolescent mental health.
142	However, traditional research approaches that focus on differences between families in terms of cohesion and conflict often ignore the day-to-day variability within a given family, which may provide important new information.
143	This study involved 151 caregivers from families with two caregivers at home (95.3% female) and their adolescent children (61.5% female). Using 21 days of daily records, we tested whether daily changes in family functioning were associated with daily changes in adolescents' well-being, and whether adolescents' well-being depends on the average level of family functioning.
144	We employed multilevel models to examine the interconnections between family cohesion and family conflict, their feelings of anger, frustration, and anxiety with adolescents, and happiness, life satisfaction, and meaning and purpose in life.
145	The study concluded that meaningful changes were demonstrated on a daily basis in terms of cohesion and conflict.
146	There were specific associations within families between adolescent-reported cohesion and conflict and the six pubertal outcomes.
147	Models using data on family functioning reported by the parent side yielded fewer associations than models using data reported by the adolescent side.
148	The present study has several additional findings.
149	Cross-level interactions showed that differences in family cohesion were only associated with adolescent depression in families with cohesion levels below the average.
150	In summary, this study provides compelling evidence that family life shows significant differences on a daily basis, and these daily differences have important consequences for the well-being of adolescents.
151	To investigate the clinical outcomes and prognostic factors of newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients aged 10-18 years, and to provide a basis for clinical selection of treatment.
152	The clinical data of 119 patients aged 10-18 years with newly diagnosed ALL, including baseline clinical characteristics, remission effects of induction therapy, long-term outcomes, relapses, and deaths, admitted to the Second Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Jinan between January 2008 and December 2015, were retrospectively reviewed, and the factors influencing clinical outcomes were evaluated univariately and multivariately.
153	There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients who achieved complete remission by week 5 after induction therapy between those who received the ALL-2005 protocol and the ALL-2009 protocol (P > 0.05).
154	The 5-year cumulative event-free survival and overall survival rates for the 119 patients were (63.4 ± 3.65)% and (68.95 ± 4.01)%, respectively, while at 7 years they were (61.86 ± 3.72)% and (67.22 ± 3.59)%.
155	At follow-up, there were no significant differences in cumulative event-free and overall survival rates, rates of overall relapse, extramedullary relapse, time to relapse, and survival comparisons between patients treated with the ALL-2005 protocol and the ALL-2009 protocol (P > 0.05). The survival rate of the group with extramedullary relapse was significantly higher than that of the group with myeloid relapse (P < 0.05). The late recurrence group had a significantly higher survival rate than the early recurrence group (P < 0.05).
156	The results of univariate analysis showed that age, gender, efficacy of induction therapy, risk, and fusion gene were significant prognostic factors for patients (P < 0.05); however, the results of multivariate analysis by Cox regression model showed that male gender, nonresponse to induction therapy, and high risk were independent risk factors for poor patient outcome (P < 0.05).
157	The ALL-2009 regimen resulted in slightly improved survival compared to the ALL-2005 regimen in newly diagnosed ALL patients aged 10-18 years with bcr-abl, and is more applicable to the combined bcr-abl.
158	This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the relationship between a parent's nurturing of a child's coping abilities (SOC) and the child's emotion regulation abilities is long-term.
159	Samples were from 256 parents whose children were between 5 and 12 years of age (child mean age = 8.36, SD = 2.03, 54.7% male; Parental mean age = 34.49, SD = 6.20, 59% female).
160	Participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire at initiation and at 12 months for collection of data on demographic information, parenting behaviors, and children's emotion regulation abilities.
161	The results of the structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis conducted longitudinally indicated that parental SOC measured at baseline predicted the outcomes of maladaptation and emotion regulation maladaptation measured 12 months later in the child.
162	More specifically, the parent's suggestion of positively nurturing aspects of the child's coping strategies predicted resilience in the child's emotion regulation, while the parent's lack of nurturing of the child's coping skills predicted poor resilience in the child's emotion regulation dimension.
163	In addition, child gender played a moderating role in the longitudinal association between parents' positively developing coping strategies and children's emotion regulation adaptations: Although this association was relatively small for girls and larger and statistically significant for boys.
164	The current findings emphasize the significance of SOC for parents due to its ability to enhance emotion regulation in children aged 5 to 12 years.
165	Multiple endocrine neoplasia type IIB (MEN IIB) is a rare autosomal dominant condition caused by mutations in the RET gene and has a specific clinical phenotype, including mucosal neuromas, marfanoid habitus, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma.
166	The condition is under-recognized by clinicians and diagnosis is often delayed.
167	A patient with MEN IIB, who had a lingual mucosal neuroma since a young age and had been surgically treated for mitral valve prolapse and spinal deformity, was admitted to the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University in November 2018. He was diagnosed with medullary thyroid carcinoma and underwent surgical treatment at the age of 22, but was not clinically diagnosed with MEN IIB until the discovery of pheochromocytoma at the age of 28.
168	Genetic testing suggested that the patient carried a de novo heterozygous RET gene p.M918T mutation.
169	Early recognition of clinical manifestations outside the endocrine system and RET gene screening in clinical practice are crucial for early diagnosis and treatment.
170	We investigated the molecular pathogenesis by detecting the phenotype and mutation analysis in a family with inherited factor V (FV) deficiency caused by a compound heterozygous mutation. The plasma prothrombin time (PT) was measured in the proband and family members (10 persons in three generations). Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB), factor V procoagulant activity (FV:C), factor V antigen (FV:Ag), and other relevant coagulation parameters were used to confirm the diagnosis.
171	All exons, flanking, 5' and 3' untranslated regions of the F5 gene and corresponding mutation site regions in family members were analyzed by direct DNA sequencing, and the mutations found were confirmed by reverse sequencing.
172	The conservation of the mutated amino acids was analyzed using ClustalX-2.1-win software; PROVEAN and MutationTaster online bioinformatics software were used to predict the effects of the mutations on protein function, and Swiss PDB Viewer software was used to perform protein modeling and amino acid interaction analysis at the mutation sites. The PT and APTT of the probands were significantly longer than those of the normal control healthy subjects, 34.2 vs 13.2 s and 119.3 vs 36.0 s, respectively; the FⅧ:C and FⅧ:Ag were extremely decreased, by 3% and 6%, respectively.
173	The proband's second and third children, as well as the daughter and grandson, had slightly prolonged PT and APTT, variably reduced F V ∶ C and F V ∶ Ag, while coagulation parameters were within normal limits in other family members.
174	The proband had a c.911g > a heterozygous missense mutation in exon 6, resulting in p.Gly276Glu; there was a c.5343c > G heterozygous missense mutation in exon 16 resulting in p.Ser1781Arg.
175	His second, third sons and grandson were all heterozygous for p.Gly276Glu, his daughter was heterozygous for p.Ser1781Arg, and other family members were wild type.
176	The results of conservation analysis showed that Gly276 and Ser1781 were highly conserved among homologous species.
177	The prediction results of the two bioinformatics software were identical, with PROVEAN (scores -6.214 and -12.79) indicating that the compound heterozygous mutation was deleterious; MutationTaster (scores 0.976 and 0.999) suggested that these mutations might cause the corresponding diseases.
178	Protein modeling analysis of the p.Gly276Glu mutation revealed that the Glu side chain was elongated and its molecular weight increased, which could increase the steric hindrance between it and the surrounding amino acids, affect the normal local folding of the FV protein, and ultimately lead to reduced protein activity.
179	The spatial structural analysis of the p.ser1781arg mutant protein could not be performed in this study because the X-ray 3D structural file of Fþ in exon 16 was not available. The novel compound heterozygous mutations (p.gly276glu and p.ser1781arg) identified in this study are the main cause of decreased Fþ levels in this family, and p.ser1781arg has rarely been reported domestically and internationally.
180	The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has now become a global pandemic and a significant public health issue.
181	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious and primarily targets the lungs of patients, causing respiratory distress syndrome and potentially multiple organ failure.
182	The kidney is also one of the major organs challenged by viruses, which directly injure the renal tubules via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and cause cytokine storms leading to renal injury, increasing the risk of death in patients.
183	Early identification of risk factors for renal injury in COVID-19 patients, detection of indicators of renal injury, and prompt supportive care and renal replacement therapy in patients with the presence of renal injury may reduce the case fatality rate.
184	Objective: To obtain protein expression profiles of postmortem rat liver tissues using the 2100 Bioanalyzer combined with protein chip, and to speculate the relationship with postmortem interval.
185	After the rats were euthanized with intraperitoneal anesthesia and placed in a 16 °C environment, water-soluble proteins were extracted from liver tissues at 14 time points post-mortem, and protein expression profiling data with relative molecular masses ranging from 14,000 to 230,000 were acquired using protein chip analysis. The data were analyzed by partial least squares discriminant analysis and Fisher's discriminant analysis.
186	The time to death results were classified into group A (0 days), group B (1-9 days), and group C (12-30 days) based on changes in protein expression profiles and PLS-DA results.
187	After Fisher's discrimination, the prediction accuracies of the model in both the training and test sets were 100.0%, and the internal cross-validation accuracies of the training set were 100.0%.
188	The prediction accuracy of the training and test sets in panel B was 100.0%, and the internal cross-validation accuracy of the training set was 100.0% by building Fisher's discriminant model to narrow down the inferred time window at each time point in panels B and C; the prediction accuracies of the training and test sets in panel C were 95.2% and 78.6%, respectively, and the internal cross-validation accuracy of the training set was 88.1%.
189	Conclusions: The protein chip assay can quickly and easily obtain the expression profiles of water-soluble proteins with a relative molecular mass between 14,000 and 230,000 in liver tissue at different time points after rat death, and establish PLS-DA and Fisher's discrimination models for classification prediction of postmortem interval judgment, potentially offering a new idea and method for estimating the postmortem interval.
190	Primary health care offers a cost-effective route to achieving universal health coverage (UHC).
191	However, primary health-care systems are weak in many low- and middle-income countries and often fail to provide comprehensive people-centered integrated care.
192	We analyzed the primary health-care systems in 20 low- and middle-income countries using a semi-grounded approach.
193	Alternatives for strengthening the primary care system were identified by analyzing the subject content.
194	We found that: (i) despite the growing burden of noncommunicable diseases, many low- and middle-income countries lacked funds for preventive services; (ii) community health workers are often under-resourced, poorly supported, and lack the appropriate training; (iii) out-of-pocket medical expenses exceeded 40% of the total health expenditure in half of the countries studied, not conducive to equity; (iv) the fragmentation of public and private systems, underfunding, corruption, and poor engagement of informal workers prevent the implementation of health insurance plans.
195	In 14 countries, the private sector is largely unregulated.
196	Moreover, community engagement in primary health care was weak in countries where services were basically privatized.
197	In some countries, decentralization has led to the fragmentation of primary health care.
198	Performance improves when financial incentives are combined with regulations and quality improvement, and when community engagement is enhanced.
199	Adequate resources should be allocated for policy-making in primary health care, and government spending on primary health care should be increased by at least 1% of the gross domestic product.
200	Developing equity-enhancing financing schemes and improving the accountability of primary health-care management is also needed.
201	Support from the primary health care system is critical to achieving Universal Health Coverage by the end of 2030.
202	Li-Fraumeni syndrome, an inherited disorder with an approximate 90% chance of lifetime cancer development, requires family members to undergo comprehensive cancer screening throughout their lives.
203	This article examines the role of health care in managing the risks and treatment of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, as experienced by parents, adolescents, and adult children.
204	Twenty-three families participated in the study, using semi-structured interviews.
205	The composition of the families consisted of 2-5 family members, with the younger generation of each family spanning ages 7-40 years.
206	Using grassroots theory methodology, we developed open-ended and centralized decoding of the interview contributions.
207	Family members describe how the role of a health leader is fulfilled within the family, but also the maturation of children, the death of a certain family member, and other factors that all determine who has undertaken what roles, and how these roles have changed over time.
208	They often express a collective shared responsibility to help relatives understand LFS and implement appropriate cancer risk management.
209	Family members fulfilled their health roles by accompanying visits to medical facilities for support and information gathering.
210	The role of a health leader is intergenerational, providing the necessary support to families, particularly in complex health care decisions.
211	Our findings offer insights into health care providers, focusing on how patients with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) and their relatives make unique medical decisions and take on caregiving roles, deeply impacted by the hereditary nature of LFS, and how these roles have evolved over time.
212	Providers who can adapt to dynamic changes in family roles are better able to meet the psychosocial and medical needs of relatives, primarily by striving to understand the functioning of the family system affected by LFS and helping family members support each other.
213	Abstract: Corneal inking (corneal keratopigmentation, KTP) has a long history in the treatment of patients with corneal clouding.
214	Due to the updates and improvements in KTP surgical techniques and the low incidence of complications, it is often considered for patients with therapeutic or functional indications.
215	This article illustrates the clinical application of KTP in cosmetics and function, and discusses the surgical effects of KTP and its characteristics in experimental and histopathological studies.
216	To explore the vascular conditions required and the necessity of revascularization when using the tibial lateral bone graft technique to treat chronic ischemic disease of the lower extremity from the perspective of vascular surgery.
217	The clinical data of 59 patients with lower extremity chronic ischemic disease treated by the lateral tibial bone moving technique from February 2014 to July 2019 were retrospectively reviewed.
218	Among them, 41 patients had diabetic foot (DF) disease with Wagner grades 3-4, Texas grades 2-3, and stage B-D disease; disease duration ranged from 0.7 to 2.4 years with a mean of 1.5 years; five patients had combined lower extremity arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO).
219	There were 14 ASO patients with disease durations ranging from 1.5 to 23.4 months (mean 10.8 months; Fontaine IV, Rutherford III-IV).
220	Four patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) had disease durations ranging from 2.1 to 18.2 months, with a mean of 12.3 months; the clinical stages were all three stages.
221	Of these, 18 patients, either with a preoperative anterior or posterior tibial artery ankle brachial index (ABI) less than 0.6, or who did not show all three branches of the anterior tibial artery at the knee on imaging examinations, underwent revascularization to open an upstream vessel (5 with diabetic foot and arteriosclerosis obliterans, 12 with arteriosclerosis obliterans, and 1 with thromboangiitis obliterans).
222	Postoperatively, the healing outcomes of ulcers were evaluated by wound healing status, skin temperature, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, ABI, and CT angiography (CTA) examinations.
223	Patients with diabetic foot were followed for 8-16 months (mean 12.2 months); all ulcerated wounds healed within a healing time of 5.1-9.2 weeks (mean 6.8 weeks). Five patients who underwent revascularization were observed to have recanalization of branches of the anterior tibial artery below the knee on postoperative CTA. All tibial osteotomies healed within a healing time of 5-14 weeks (mean 8.3 weeks).
224	Patients with ASOs were followed from 13 to 25 months (mean, 16.8 months); the ulcer wound healing time ranged from 6.2 to 9.7 weeks (mean 7.4 weeks); among them, 12 revascularizers showed recanalization of the anterior tibial artery branch below the knee on postoperative CTA examination; all tibial osteotomies healed with a healing time of 4.5-14.4 weeks (mean 10.2 weeks).
225	Patients with Tao were followed from 12 to 23 months (mean, 12.3 months); the treatment was ineffective and ultimately resulted in toe and/or limb amputation.
226	When analyzed in subgroups according to whether the patients had undergone revascularization, the 6-month postoperative Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, and skin temperature in the combined revascularization group were all significantly improved compared with the preoperative values (ABI ≥ 0.6 in the anterior and/or posterior tibial arteries, imaging studies showing that at least 1 of the 3 branches of the anterior tibial artery below the knee reaches the ankle and is a prerequisite for the success of lateral tibial bone transfer techniques for the treatment of chronic ischemic diseases of the lower extremity).
227	DF indicates the lateral tibial bone migration technique, which is optional for Aso, and should be used with caution for Tao.
228	To investigate the volatile organic compound (VOC) profiles in the exhaled breath fractions of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients, and to explore the feasibility of VOCs for APL diagnosis and efficacy assessment. We used SPME-GC/MS to detect VOCs in the exhaled breath of subjects with APL and healthy subjects; in a comparative analysis of the VOC components in the exhaled breath of patients with APL in the initial diagnosis group, the relapse group, the remission group, and the healthy group, the differences in the VOCs characteristic of the different disease states groups of APL were analyzed by using the Kruskal Wallis variance test and applying the Dunn Bonferroni test for pairwise comparisons. The values of dimethyl sulfide, toluene, and decadiene were significantly higher in patients with newly diagnosed APL than in healthy subjects, whereas the values of ethanol and N-hexane and benzaldehyde were significantly lower than in healthy subjects (P < 0.05).
229	Dimethyl sulfide, toluene, and dodecane were significantly decreased, and ethanol, n-hexane, and benzaldehyde were significantly increased in the remission group compared with the initial diagnosis group (P < 0.05), while the VOCs in the relapse group were exactly the opposite of the remission group. Dimethyl sulfide, toluene, dodecane, ethanol, benzaldehyde, and n-hexane can be used as biomarkers for APL diagnosis and disease assessment.
230	The onset, progression, and management of mental health problems take a relatively long time, so a significant proportion of psychiatric research—particularly research that can definitively answer the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors—requires multiple assessments over time for patients and their living environments.
231	However, many researchers in psychiatry use incorrect statistical methods to analyze this type of longitudinal data, resulting in unrecognized biases in the analysis results and therefore incorrect conclusions.
232	This article provides an introduction to the topic of longitudinal data analysis.
233	This article examines the different dataset structures used in longitudinal data analysis, the classification and handling of missing data, and the methods to correct for within-individual correlations when using longitudinal data to build multiple regression models.
234	Taking into account the material characteristics of combined acupuncture needles, emerging connection technologies, and the injection molding process, and following mechanical testing, a new electroacupuncture instrument was developed featuring a magnetic joint closely proximal to acupuncture needles, standardized external regulations, and a straightforward fabrication process.
235	Constructed of an inner magnet joint and an outer protective cuff of the joint, this joint utilizes the emerging conductive gel connection to simplify the device fabrication process, offering advantages such as relying on magnetic force to connect with acupuncture needles, easy storage when idle, easy switching to work status, and the ability to be rapidly disconnected in an emergency situation.
236	The joints with acupuncture needles rely on magnetic forces to safely and firmly connect, reduce operating time, improve work efficiency, and effectively solve the problems that currently exist with alligator clip joints.
237	High-income partners experienced significantly higher rates of relationship disintegration compared to low-income partners, which included divorce and breakups with cohabiting partners.
238	Recognizing that relationship interventions can make differences in the outcomes of relationship development, related measures are increasingly being used for this type of population.
239	However, the effects of these interventions on the relationships of low-income partners were very limited.
240	Interventions for relationship issues among low-income couples must be effective and tailored to their specific needs by utilizing descriptive data categories that reflect the couples’ own perceptions of problems in their relationship, and should compare these interventions to those used by high-income couples in assessing their own needs.
241	The sample for this study was drawn from 5,000 individuals recruited online who were seeking relationship intervention online and also compared the relationship status and living situation of the two groups of individuals, low- and high-income partners.
242	Results indicated that relationship-seeking interventions by low-income partners experienced higher levels of distress (lower relationship satisfaction, greater major relationship problems, and relationship stability) and higher levels of tension across life situations (more children living at home, less likely to have a full-time job, and health state worry).
243	The results suggest that future interventions should focus on the needs of low-income partners, and that physicians treating such individuals should be prepared to handle higher levels of relationship tension, various factors contributing to strain in their living environments, which are less common when treating more affluent partners during weekdays.
244	With industrial development, musculoskeletal disorders have become increasingly prominent, with lower back pain being a major issue, leading the United States and Germany to classify it as an occupational disease.
245	It is therefore of great significance to identify occupational factors affecting low back pain to evaluate the load level of workers.
246	In this review, combined with existing literature, evaluation methods for low back pain load are discussed, with the hope of providing a reference for developing preventive strategies for low back pain at the occupational level.
247	Research has linked men's childhood adverse experiences (ACES) and psychotraumatic symptoms to their experiences of IPV crime (intimate partner violence) and abuse, but several important aspects that play a blocking role when interventions are implemented for violence have not been studied in depth.
248	Specifically, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has dominated the spectrum of traumatic symptoms studied in this area, limiting investigators' understanding of other manifestations of trauma, particularly trauma in men.
249	Additionally, most studies have only focused on males' IPV criminal behavior in a physical context, with few addressing other aspects such as different types of IPV behavior, the severity of the violence, or male perpetration.
250	Additionally, few studies have concentrated on potential protective factors within the ACE framework, such as perceptual behavior in clinical populations.
251	Finally, the majority of the studies conducted have not focused on Coloureds, although some racial/ethnic minority groups have relatively high exposure rates to IPV.
252	For the aforementioned reasons, this study explored the interrelationship between the frequency and severity (psychological, physical, injuries) of IPV and adverse childhood experiences, PTSD, trauma symptomatology (distinct from PTSD), as well as perceived self-efficacy.
253	The sample consisted of 67 men of color, primarily low-income, who were enrolled in an intervention program for abusive behaviors.
254	More than half of the sample (51.5%) reported experiencing four or more adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in previous years, and 31.1% of the subjects met the diagnostic criteria for suspected PTSD.
255	Higher ACE scores predicted higher rates of self-reported IPV crime and higher proportions of victimization for nearly all types.
256	PTSD symptoms and the severity of complex traumatic symptoms combined explain 13% to 40% of IPV outcomes, and each outcome is uniquely associated with certain types of self-reported IPV victimization and the frequency and severity of violent implementation.
257	Perceived self-efficacy was associated with a reduction in the occurrence of criminal behavior and experiences of victimization, with a trend toward reduction in the frequency and severity of intimate partner violence (IPV) in self-reported psychological aspects.
258	This study reviews relevant clinical measures undertaken for a non-mainstream, marginalized male population, including screening, training, and possible therapeutic intervention approaches.
259	The close connection between family members has a significant impact on adolescents' well-being and contributes to their physical, psychological, and social health.
260	However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood.
261	The present study is a long-term investigation into the mechanisms of strong familial ties recognized by adolescents, which predict increasingly positive health behaviors and decreasingly negative health behaviors over time.
262	We particularly endeavored to figure out whether adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies reconciled the link between family closeness and self-reported health status on the adolescent side.
263	Data for this study were obtained from 1774 New Zealand adolescents aged 10 to 17 years who completed self-report questionnaires 3 times a year.
264	By using a longitudinal mediation path model, we tested whether maladaptive and adaptive coping strategies at T2 play a reconciling role between family closeness at T1 and general health, vitality, sleep sufficiency, physical satisfaction, substance use, and self-harm at T3.
265	The findings indicated that close family relationships predicted higher levels of adaptive coping skills and that adaptive coping skills predicted higher health indicators but not lower disease indicators.
266	In addition, strong relatedness among family members predicted lower levels of maladaptation in the face of stressful setbacks, which in turn predicted higher levels of positive health outcomes and less adverse health outcomes.
267	The results of the present study suggest that the close connection of family members has a positive impact on adolescent health by increasing the use of adaptive coping strategies, reducing the use of poor adjustment strategies in response to stressful setbacks, or both.
268	These results have important implications for clinical therapists working with adolescents and parents, and for those involved in developing health promotion programs.
269	Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 12% of the global population, with 4.3 million people blind and 15 million visually impaired.
270	In SSA, there are only 2.5 ophthalmologists per million people.
271	Therefore, training ophthalmologists in this field is crucial.
272	We designed a systematic literature review protocol and searched MEDLINE Ovid and Embase OVID for literature published between August 1, 2019, and 2000.
273	We also searched Google Scholar and the websites of ophthalmic institutions for additional information.
274	This paper includes a total of 49 references and uses a narrative approach to analyze the results.
275	There are 56 training institutions for ophthalmologists in eleven Anglophone, eleven Francophone, and two Lusophone SSA countries.
276	The median duration of ophthalmic training programs was 4 years.
277	Most curricula have been regionally standardized.
278	National, provincial, and international collaboration is a key feature of ophthalmology training in more than half of the ophthalmology training programs.
279	Although it may not always be based on evidence, there has been a drive for professional refinement in the area.
280	Available published scientific data on ophthalmic medical and surgical training in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is scarce, especially in Francophone and Lusophone countries.
281	However, through a broad review strategy, it is possible to obtain a valuable and detailed view of ophthalmic training in SSA.
282	The training of ophthalmologists is a complex and multifaceted task.
283	Existing training institutions face challenges in appropriate selection, capacity, and funding.
284	Numerous learning outcomes require an appropriate curriculum, time, faculty, support, and assessment.
285	Modern training approaches offer many opportunities.
286	Partnership is key.
287	Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor.
288	Since the 1970s, people have used chemotherapy drugs to treat osteosarcoma.
289	However, multidrug resistance, as one of the major adverse reactions that affects the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs, leads to varying degrees of reduced survival rates in osteosarcoma patients.
290	The Notch signaling pathway plays an important role in osteosarcoma cell proliferation and simultaneously affects drug resistance by reducing intracellular drug accumulation, regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition, dysregulating microRNA, disrupting the expression of apoptosis genes, and controlling tumor stem cells.
291	To investigate the levels of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in the bone marrow of multiple myeloma patients and its association with osteolytic lesions of myeloma, and to explore the clinical significance of CTGF in multiple myeloma bone disease.
292	54 MM patients treated in our hospital from March 2019 to April 2020 were selected, while 28 healthy volunteers were selected as the control group, and after collecting the bone marrow from the subjects, the bone marrow supernatant was isolated, and the CTGF protein expression level in the bone marrow supernatant was detected by double antibody sandwich microplate immunoassay (ELISA). The relationship between them and clinically relevant measures was analyzed. MM patients had significantly higher CTGF levels than healthy controls (P < 0.001). CTGF levels were significantly higher in male patients than in female patients (P = 0.007). MM patients with bone disease had significantly higher CTGF levels than patients without bone disease and controls (P = 0.007, P = 0.001).
293	CTGF levels in mm were positively correlated with the number of lesions with bone damage (r = 0.52) and were significantly higher in patients with ≥ 3 bone lesions compared with those with < 3 bone lesions and those without (P = 0.014, P = 0.002, respectively).
294	The results of the ROC curve indicate that CTGF expression levels are of significant value for the diagnosis of MM bone disease (P < 0.001).
295	Abnormally high CTGF levels in patients with multiple myeloma correlate with the extent of osteolytic lesions in the myeloma and reflect disease progression.
296	The concentrations of airborne pollutants and pathogenic bacteria directly affect human health.
297	At constant pollution sources, effective ventilation determines the superiority or inferiority of air quality.
298	Therefore, establishing a quantitative determination index of effective ventilation, and using this indicator to carry out real-time evaluation of air quality in specific areas, leading residents to choose healthy outdoor active sites becomes an urgent problem to solve.
299	In this study, the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) method was used to establish an urban air pollution simulation system based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques to investigate the relationship between wind speed, pollutant concentration, and pollutant diffusion efficiency.
300	On this basis, wind field simulations and air quality evaluations were conducted in different periods of urban square space with the help of real-time meteorological data.
301	The results show that the critical wind speed value for efficient diffusion of pollutants in the air at pedestrian height (1.5 m) is 1.0 m/s.
302	To achieve the World Health Organization's goal of "eliminating viral hepatitis as a major public health threat by 2030," the field of therapeutic development for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) has been rapidly advancing in recent years.
303	Early phase clinical trials (including first-in-human trials) focus on the selection of subjects, study design, choice of dose and mode of administration, dose escalation, monitoring of adverse events/reactions (tolerability evaluation), observation and reporting procedures, and criteria for subjects to continue dosing and discontinue dosing.
304	Quantitative pharmacological knowledge is required to analyze the relationship between the in vivo exposure of drugs and their efficacy and adverse effects, and to incorporate exploratory indicators such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA, HBV core-related antigen (hbcrag), etc., to examine the mechanisms and targets of new drugs and their effectiveness against HBV covalently closed circular DNA within hepatocytes.
305	However, phase II-III trials focused more on the optimal dose, efficacy, and safety indicators to verify the efficacy and safety of the new drug at the dose selected in a larger subject population.
306	Based on relevant domestic and international literature, and combined with the author's practical experience from early clinical studies, a brief introduction is given to the clinical issues that should be considered in the design of clinical trials for innovative drugs for chronic hepatitis B (CHB).
307	In Uganda, one in every five children has some form of mental health issues, including disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs).
308	DBDs can persist into adulthood with numerous adverse consequences.
309	Effective interventions targeting disruptive behavior disorders have been developed and tested in highly deprived communities in developed countries.
310	But in most African countries like Uganda, relevant interventions remain rare.
311	The paper describes an adaptation process for an evidence-based intervention originating from the United States to optimize and maintain original validity when possible under Uganda's national conditions.
312	As part of a randomized test, this paper surveys adolescents presenting with behavioral problems and their caregivers from 30 schools in Uganda.
313	The research process involved the following: initial participation of organizational principals and teachers in meetings to introduce the main concepts and interventions of the study; organizing Ugandan teams during the initiation phase to integrate learning about the content related to 4Rs and 2SS; inviting community stakeholders to actively participate and provide additional feedback on the content and cultural relevance of the interventions; final revision of the instruction manual; and collecting children's drawings for use in editing the manuals.
314	This paper describes the original interventions and the adapted intervention program in terms of content as well as similarities and differences in implementation methods.
315	The findings also highlight the importance of involving community stakeholders in the process of accommodating modifications.
316	To summarize the current state of knowledge on classification, diagnosis, and clinical treatment options for Achilles tendinopathy.
317	Research literature on Achilles tendinopathy from both domestic and international sources was retrieved, and the findings were primarily summarized in terms of classification and nomenclature, imaging diagnosis, and clinical treatment options.
318	The classification and naming of Achilles tendinopathy are not completely consistent, the concept is vague, the etiology remains unclear, there are numerous treatment options, but effective evidence-based studies are lacking.
319	The diagnosis and treatment of Achilles tendinopathy are complex and need further clarification according to the characteristics of Achilles tendon anatomy and etiology in order to more effectively guide clinical treatment and facilitate the exchange of experience and learning.
320	AI, a rapidly developed science and technology based on electronic computer technology, has been applied to many aspects of human society and is increasingly used in medicine. The development and application of AI in oral medicine can, to some extent, lead the future of oral medicine.
321	Oral medicine professionals need to recognize, learn, and master AI technology, closely following the pace of the new era of medicine and developing applications in medical practice.
322	This article provides an introduction to the application and research of AI in oral medicine, scientific research, teaching, and technology, and it also offers a perspective on the future development of AI in oral medicine.
323	Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are an important treatment for chronic hepatitis B.
324	DAAS can directly interfere with the virus's infectious replication process and reduce progeny virus yield, which in turn impacts the dynamic equilibrium between two processes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in vivo: virus replication in hepatocytes versus virus attenuation in the cycle, and replenishment of the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) pool versus virus attenuation in cccDNA.
325	Existing nucleoside (acid) analogs are sufficient to affect the first equilibrium, but it is difficult to disrupt the second.
326	Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel DAAs by targeting different steps in the replication of HBV infection.
327	To replenish both aspects of this balance from the cccDNA pool to the cccDNA decay, we explore the main recent progress in the development of DAAs.
328	To investigate the role of STAT3 in apoptosis and immune escape of drug-resistant leukemia cells, and to explore the potential mechanism behind leukemia relapse caused by minimal residual disease in leukemia.
329	K562 cells were transfected with pcdna3.1-stat3 plasmid to establish the drug-resistant leukemia cell line K562/STAT3 cells.
330	RQ-PCR and/or Western blot were used to determine the expression of STAT3, Bax, and NKG2D ligands in K562 cells and K562/STAT3 cells from a control cell line transfected with an empty plasmid.
331	The apoptosis of K562 cells and K562/STAT3 cells, as well as the killing of these cells by NK cells, was assessed by flow cytometry.
332	Both total and phosphorylated STAT3 levels were significantly increased in K562/STAT3 cells, as well as the expression of P-gp mRNA, a drug-resistant protein (P < 0.005).
333	Compared with K562 - / - cells, K562 / STAT3 cells showed a significant decrease in the expression level of Bax mRNA, a proapoptotic gene (P = 0.005), and a decrease in K562 / STAT3 apoptosis induced by doxorubicin (P = 0.002). Treatment of K562 / STAT3 cells with a STAT3 inhibitor (sh-4-54) significantly increased the expression level of the proapoptotic gene Bax mRNA (P = 0.017) and concomitantly increased apoptosis (P = 0.005).
334	The mRNA levels of NKG2D ligands (mica and ulbp1) were significantly decreased in K562/STAT3 cells compared with K562 cells (P < 0.0001), as were the expression levels of mica and ulbp1 proteins (MICA: P = 0.001, ulbp1: P = 0.022). Treatment of K562/STAT3 cells with a STAT3 inhibitor (sh-4-54) increased the expression levels of mica mRNA and protein (mRNA: P = 0.001, protein: P = 0.002), but ulbp1 mRNA and protein levels were not significantly changed (mRNA: P = 0.137, protein: P = 0.1905).
335	The ability of NK cells to kill drug-resistant K562/STAT3 cells was reduced compared with that of K562 cells (P = 0.002), but STAT3 inhibition restored the sensitivity of K562/STAT3 cells to killing by NK cells (P = 0.006). STAT3 phosphorylation mediated resistance to apoptosis and reduced the sensitivity to killing by NK cells in drug-resistant leukemia cells.
336	STAT3 inhibitors can promote apoptosis of drug-resistant leukemia cells and increase their killing sensitivity by NK cells.
337	This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the influence of parental attachment on adolescent posttraumatic growth (PTG).
338	It was assessed in 872 Chinese adolescents using a self-report questionnaire 9 and a half years after the Wenchuan earthquake.
339	The results showed a direct association between parental attachment and PTG, with two significant first-order indirect associations (via justice beliefs and cognitive reappraisal), two significant second-order indirect associations (via justice beliefs to security and via cognitive reappraisal), and one significant third-order indirect association (via safety feeling, justice beliefs to cognitive reappraisal).
340	The results showed that feelings of security, justice beliefs, and cognitive reappraisal mediated the association between parental attachment and PTG.
341	These findings highlight the importance of family perspectives, showing that clinical psychologists can facilitate adolescents' post-traumatic growth by helping them establish positive parental attachments.
