1	Introduction: In patients with severe and morbid obesity it has been observed that bioelectrical assessment (BIA) leads to an underestimation of fat mass (FM) and weight lost as FM after bariatric surgery.
2	Objective: To assess the reliability of BIA for estimating total body water (TBW), GLM, FM and changes after 6 months of a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (severely obese BPGYR) in patients.
3	Methods: 36 adults with an indication of BPGYR were studied prospectively.
4	The deuterium ACT (D) was measured and MLG and MG were calculated.
5	With double frequency BIA (5 and 200 kHz) (Bodistat Dualscan®), FM, MLG, ACT, extracellular water (AEC), intracellular water and AIC ratios were estimated.
6	The ACS / AIC ratio showed a positive correlation with the overestimation of MLG by BIA (r = 0.49; p = 0.002).
7	After surgery, the differences between BIA and D were not significant and the MLG estimation error was not correlated with the ACS / AIC ratio.
8	Conclusions: BIA underestimates the FM as reported, which is reduced after weight reduction, underestimating the weight lost as MG and overestimating the loss of MLG.
9	Future investigations may assess whether these errors are replicated with other BIA teams.
10	The objective of this study was to construct and validate a short form of the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI).
11	The NPI is the most widely applied measure for the assessment of narcissistic personality traits and is therefore of great relevance to many research questions on personality and social psychology.
12	To develop the short scale, we first found the optimal solution of eight items among all valid combinations of NPI-15 items in an exploratory sub-sample
13	(C)
14	Non-Immersive VR environments are less interactivity applied to virtual reality techniques, so interaction with the virtual reality environment can occur in common without 3D television immersion.
15	This study shows how exposure to TV-3D, combined with physiological registration, can induce fear of cockroaches in people with different levels of fear.
16	In addition, more fearful participants are more likely to trigger the emergence of cockroaches in the virtual reality environment due to their cardiac acceleration.
17	Overall results suggest that our VR environment is valid to induce fear of cockroaches, with potential use in the therapeutic domain.
18	Infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the development of all manifestations of COVID-19 predispose to arterial and venous thromboembolic disease.
19	The coagulation system can be activated by various viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.
20	Vascular endothelial damage, combined with the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation, affects the prognosis and mortality of this disease.
21	Treatment is aimed at prevention, early detection and timely intervention of all coagulation disorders generated by COVID-19.
22	The recommended anticoagulant is low molecular weight heparin, taking into account creatinine clearance, and if major invasive procedures are performed, unfractionated heparin is a safe option.
23	Throughout history, pandemics have had a great impact on humanity.
24	Measures used to combat them caused collateral damage.
25	In the COVID-19 pandemic, the actions generated to reduce exposure, the number of infections and the death rate imply a focus on reducing mortality, but even more deaths can occur.
26	In turn, both medical staff and patients are affected by the economic slowdown and the ""effect of negativity"".
27	This review article analyzed the different tools for controlling the pandemic, its development in a historical context and how they impact risk stratification for vulnerable patients (elderly, chronically degenerative and oncological patients).
28	Its presentation is acute respiratory insufficiency characterized by hyperinflation of the lung leading to increased capillaries and epithelial permeability, with loss of aeration of lung tissue and increased pulmonary rigidity.
29	These alterations lead to imbalances between ventilation and the infusion ratio, which ultimately result in hypoxaemia and deterioration of carbon dioxide purification.
30	For the present review, a search was conducted in PubMed and Trip Database.
31	Due to the scarcity of publications, a specific search algorithm was not used.
32	The aim is to make known, in accordance with the evidence and recommendations of national and international experts, the hemodynamic and respiratory management of these patients.
33	The objective of this work was to measure the occurrence of multimorbidity and to estimate the number of individuals in the Brazilian population, 50 years or older, at risk of serious COVID-19.
34	This is a nationwide cross-sectional study, using data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study on Ageing (ELSI-Brazil), conducted in 2015-2016, with 9,412 individuals aged 50 years or older.
35	Multimorbidity was characterized as ≥ 2 chronic conditions, based on a list of 15 morbidities considered to be at risk for serious COVID-19.
36	Analysis included estimation of prevalence and estimation of the absolute number of people at risk.
37	Self-evaluation of health status, frailty and basic activities of daily living were used as markers of health status.
38	Sex, age, geopolitical region and schooling were used as covariates.
39	About 80% of the individuals in the sample had at least some of the morbidities assessed, representing about 34 million individuals; multimorbidity was reported by 52% of the study population, with the highest proportion
40	Cardiovascular diseases and obesity were the most frequent chronic diseases.
41	An estimated 2.4 million Brazilians are at serious risk of health.
42	Inequalities were observed in terms of schooling.
43	The number of people aged 50 and over who have risk morbidities for COVID-19 is high in both relative and absolute terms.
44	The estimate presented is important for planning strategies for monitoring people with chronic morbidities and prevention in combating the new coronavirus.
45	The conflict between parents and adolescents has been studied as a precursor of macro and long-term development risks and as a result of the interaction patterns at each time and at the micro level.
46	However, the family-level processes underlying the maintenance or regulation of conflict in daily life are largely ignored.
47	A moderate understanding of the conflict between parents and adolescents provides important practical knowledge that has direct implications for interventions.
48	This study analyses the daily and residual reciprocal processes in the experiences of anger and conflict among parents and adolescents.
49	Better understanding of daily patterns of interaction and maintenance of conflict between parents and adolescents can guide more informed, targeted and timely interventions to improve the impact of problematic sequences of conflict between parents and adolescents.
50	To correlate the functional capacity and quality of life of elderly people hospitalized in the emergency department.
51	This is a cross-sectional and analytical study, conducted with elderly people admitted to the emergency department of a university hospital in the city of São Paulo, between December 2015 and January 2017.
52	Data were collected through interviews, using a structured questionnaire, the Medical Outcome Study 36, the Katz Daily Living Independence Index and the Functional Independence Measure.
53	Participants included 250 elderly persons, average age 71.9 years, males (56.8%), white skin color (67.2%), married (54.0%), low schooling (32.0%), low incomes (58.0%)
54	The most compromised quality of life dimensions were physical (11.4 per cent), emotional (21.6 per cent) and functional (25.2 per cent).
55	In terms of functional capacity, independence for basic daily living activities and moderate dependence on instrumental daily living activities were characterized.
56	The higher the score of the functional independence measure, the higher the quality of life score.
57	Update the estimate of mortality attributed to tobacco use in Brazil in the population aged 35 years and over.
58	A dependent prevalence method was applied, based on the population assigned fraction.
59	This method estimates the mortality attributed to the mortality observed in Brazil (source: Brazilian Unified Health System Mortality Information System, 2016); prevalence of smokers, former smokers and never smokers (2013 National Health Survey).
60	Estimates of overall attributed mortality by sex, age group (35-54; 55-64; 65-74 and 75 years) and 3 groups of diseases are presented: Malignant tumours, cardiometabolic and respiratory diseases.
61	In 2016, tobacco consumption caused 163,831 deaths in Brazil, 67 per cent (109,369) were among men and four out of ten (62,791) occurred before the age of 65.
62	Forty-two per cent of attributed mortality is associated with cardiometabolic diseases, followed by respiratory (34 per cent) and tumour (24 per cent), with no gender differences.
63	Fourteen per cent of deaths in Brazil during 2016 in the population aged 35 and over are attributable to tobacco consumption.
64	Regular MA estimates are necessary to assess and strengthen the tobacco control laws in place.
65	Recently, the European Medicines Agency has authorized the use of immunotherapy drugs for the treatment of this disease in a metastatic stage.
66	The purpose of this article is to analyze the clinical trials that allowed such authorization, and to review new therapies for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma "".
67	Comparative studies of chemotherapy therapies versus immunotherapy are currently under way, as are multiple combinations seeking additive effects with antiangiogenic drugs or targeted therapies.
68	The trauma of the peripheral vascular organ is a very frequent condition in military conflicts.
69	Fortunately, a comprehensive understanding of local and systemic pathophysiology, in addition to the development of innovative surgical techniques and technological advances, has improved survival forecasts and anatomical and functional limb conservation.
70	This paper provides a historical review of the current state of approach to peripheral vascular trauma, based on a heroic episode of the campaign for Mexico City during the United States invasion of 1846-1848: Defence of Melgustlo
71	Assess compliance with treatment monitoring and cure verification activities by Malaria Control Programme professionals.
72	This is an evaluative research, carried out through systematic observation, with the help of a Likert scale form, adopting a numerical score to assess compliance.
73	Data collection took place in the Amazon municipality of Cruzeiro do Sul in the state of Acre.
74	Data were analysed using descriptive statistics.
75	Fifteen endemic control agents, five nurses and five microscopists were observed in carrying out their functions in the programme.
76	Treatment monitoring and curative verification activities achieved the respective total compliance rates of 72.0 per cent and 12.1 per cent.
77	Microsatelists, evaluated in 9 activities, achieved a higher percentage of compliance, while nurses and endemic control agents had a partial compliance rate or did not perform certain activities.
78	The Malaria Control Programme falls below the recommended level, without meeting the established gold standard, which may mean maintaining or increasing malaria-related cases.
79	Until 2016, treatment options for patients with advanced transitional cell carcinoma progressing during or after first line treatment were limited, and vinflunine was the only drug approved in Europe for this indication.
80	The only alternatives were inclusion in a clinical trial or off-label chemotherapy with limited effectiveness and high toxicity.
81	There are other anti-FGFR treatments, conjugated antibodies and combinations of immunotherapy with drugs that enhance their effect with promising results in preliminary studies, but which must be confirmed in more advanced studies for approval.
82	For all these reasons, the treatment of advanced transitional cell carcinoma is undergoing major changes, leaving the challenge of individualizing treatment and the therapeutic sequence unchanged.
83	SUMMARY Context: Abortion is particularly difficult to measure, especially in legally restricted environments, as in Pakistan.
84	Methods: In 2018, a sample of 4,159 married women of reproductive age was recruited from two communities in Karachi.
85	Participants completed a survey that included a double-list experiment to measure abortion prevalence, as well as direct questions on abortion and other contextual characteristics.
86	The data were used to estimate direct and indirect estimates of abortion prevalence in the sample in general and by socio-demographic characteristics, as well as to test the design effect.
87	Regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between characteristics and reported abortions based on direct questions and the list experiment.
88	Results: The estimated prevalence of abortion in the list experiment was 16 per cent; the estimate from the direct question was 8 per cent.
89	No evidence of a design effect was found.
90	Notification of the number of abortions was associated with most of the characteristics selected in the regression model for the direct question, but with few characteristics in the list experiment models.
91	Conclusions: The fact that the estimate of abortion prevalence in Karachi generated from the list experiment was twice that obtained from direct questions suggests that the indirect method reduces underreporting.
92	The list experiment could be useful in estimating abortion in similar settings and improving the accuracy of data collection on other sensitive health topics.
93	The first thirty years of the nineteenth century meant for Mexico times of independence, armed struggle and also times of strong political instability.
94	The social partners had personal concerns and collective problems and the Peninsular Spaniards had to take decisions in the face of the independence movement.
95	Those who did not accept and fight it decided, in some cases, to leave voluntarily what was already their second homeland.
96	Others spoke in favor of one or the other political stance and faced banishment.
97	This is the case of two Spanish doctors: One of them, having spoken in his writings against the insurgency, accepted that the movement was irreversible and the only solution to his position was voluntary abandonment of Mexico.
98	The other suffered the forced eviction due to his ideology.
99	Here we study their parallel trajectories, aware that these lines, by definition, never intersect.
100	They did not agree during their Mexican stay, but they did support their ideologies and their contributions to medicine.
101	The reader will find information on his personal and professional lives in Spain before he enters Mexico, during his stay in Mexico and on his return to the country of origin.
102	Evidence is emerging that the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increasing among young adults, but the descriptive epidemiology needed to better understand these trends is lacking.
103	METHODS: A population-based cohort study was conducted of all adults aged 20-49 diagnosed with CRC in England between 1974 and 2015.
104	Data were extracted from the NCRAS database using the ICD9 / 10 CRC codes.
105	Temporary trends in age-specific incidence rates (incidence rates, IR) by sex, anatomical location, index of multiple deprivation index quintile and geographical region were analyzed using a regression model.
106	A total of 56,134 new CRC diagnoses were analyzed.
107	The most sustained increase in RI occurred in the 20-29 age group, mainly at the expense of an increase in distal tumors.
108	The magnitude of RI increases was similar for both sexes and IMD quintiles, although the most pronounced increases in incidence were in the southern regions of England.
109	CONCLUSION: The CRC should no longer be considered a disease of older persons: Changes in incidence rates should be taken into account in future screening policies, preventive strategies and research projects, and increase population awareness.
110	There is little qualitative literature focused on understanding the perspective of parents of adolescents involved in crime, and there is no previous literature on how being the father of an adolescent involved in crime is combined with being an immigrant parent.
111	This phenomenological study analyzed, from the perspective of immigrant parents, how they understand their children 's involvement in criminal behavior.
112	To this end, it analysed detailed semi-structured interviews with 14 immigrant parents (10 mothers and 4 fathers) from the former Soviet Union in Israel of children treated in rehabilitation centres for young offenders.
113	Data analysis revealed a gradual reduction in children 's behavior attributed to the stage of adolescent development, immigration pressures and cultural conflict.
114	These three factors intersect to create a fabric within which they see their children through crime.
115	The gradual loss of parental control is balanced by attempts to idealize the relationship between parents and children and to reduce the severity of the offences committed.
116	They describe several diverse and even contradictory experiences of themselves as parents and their struggles to build inconsistent and alternating experiences of themselves as parents.
117	Despite their fundamental role in the rehabilitation of their children, as well as their own distress, parents of children involved in criminal acts had often been ignored in investigations.
118	Recognition of parents' experiences and views can enable the development of appropriate therapeutic strategies to support them and maximize their skills to help their children.
119	Introduction.
120	The prevalence of cannabis consumption continues to increase worldwide, especially among adolescents.
121	Such consumption overlaps that of cigarettes and other licit and illicit substances, and has been associated with depressive symptoms and increased suicide risk.
122	Little is known in the Colombian context about the relationship between cannabis consumption and the risk of suicide.
123	Objective.
124	Assess the association between Cannabis consumption and suicide risk among adolescent students in Santa Marta, Colombia.
125	Materials and methods.
126	A cross-sectional study was conducted with a probability sample of middle vocational students between the ages of 13 and 17 years in both formal and private schools.
127	The consumption of Cannabis ever in life was investigated and suicide risk was quantified with the Center for Epidemiological Studies on Depression Scale.
128	Scores above eight were categorized as high suicide risk.
129	Crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) were estimated.
130	The results were as follows:
131	A total of 1,462 students participated.
132	The average age was 14.4 years (standard deviation, SD = 0.8) and 60.3% were women.
133	The lifetime prevalence of cannabis was 11.6% (95% CI 10.0-13.2) and 13.3% (95% CI 11.6-15.0) of students had high suicide risk.
134	Cannabis consumption was associated with this risk adjusted by other variables (OR = 1.88; 95% CI 1.23-2.88).
135	In this regard, it is important to note that there is a lack of progress in this area.
136	Cannabis consumption was associated with high suicide risk among adolescent students in Santa Marta, Colombia.
137	Prospective, randomized study with 40 obese patients divided into two groups: BGL 2D or 3D.
138	The main objective was to measure the time during manual gastro-jejunoanastomosis.
139	Data collection included co-morbidity, demography, operative time in three phases (creation of a reservoir, gastro-jejunoanastomosis and jejunoanastomosis) and post-surgery complications.
140	The same surgeon performed the procedures.
141	Two patients were excluded for inability to open the video.
142	Twenty patients were analyzed in the 3D group and 18 in the 2D group.
143	There were no significant differences in the pre-operative data.
144	The average procedural time was lower in the 3D group than in the 2D in 16.5 minutes.
145	The time taken to perform tasks was only significant when the gastro-jejunoanastomosis was performed.
146	There were no complications during or after surgery.
147	The use of a 3D imaging system was associated with shorter total surgical time, especially for manual gastro-jejunoanastomosis, compared to the 2D imaging system.
148	Analyse the increase in the number of sentinel cases of HIV / AIDS in Mexico calculated from the actual number of cases of infection
149	(R A cross-sectional analytical design studied the total number of COVID-19 cases in Mexico from 29 February to 24 July 2020, and compared with the sentinel cases calculated from R 3916 by 2003.
150	Epidemiological surveillance needs to be strengthened through a better case detection strategy in our country and the continued implementation of measures to contain and mitigate the HIV / AIDS pandemic.
151	Context: In 2018, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) decriminalized abortion under certain circumstances through the Maputo Protocol.
152	However, little is known about the willingness of health institutions in the country to provide comprehensive abortion services.
153	Methods: Data from 1,380 health institutions were used from the Service Delivery Assessment Inventory (EPS) to assess the readiness to provide post-abortion services in four areas: Pregnancy termination, basic post-abortion treatment.
154	The analyses used a modified application of the emergency obstetric care signal function approach; the criteria for disposal were based on World Health Organization guidelines.
155	Results: Thirty-one per cent of health institutions in the DRC met the criteria for the provision of abortion services.
156	The proportion of institutions classified as prepared was higher in urban centers than in rural areas (50% versus 26%) and hospitals compared to health centers or reference health centers (72% versus 25% and 45%, respectively).
157	Few health institutions were prepared to provide either basic services or comprehensive treatment for post-abortion complications (4 per cent and 1 per cent); greater preparedness to provide such services was in hospitals (14 per cent and 11 per cent).
158	Only one third of health institutions showed readiness to provide post-abortion contraception services.
159	Inadequate availability of medicines (e.g. misoprostol, antibiotics, contraceptives) and equipment were the biggest barriers to preparation.
160	Conclusions: Most health institutions in the DRC were not prepared to provide comprehensive abortion services.
161	Improving the availability of vital health products will increase preparedness and have the potential to reduce the prevalence of unplanned pregnancies and future demand for abortion services.
162	Multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children and adolescents temporarily associated with COVID-19 is a clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
163	It shares some characteristics with Kawasaki disease, toxic shock, sepsis, macrophage activation syndrome and myocarditis.
164	There are few publications dealing with its initial management, which is similar to that proposed for septic shock.
165	This review analyses this approach based on the characteristics of COVID-19 multisystemic inflammatory syndrome, according to the paradigm of building an ""institutional practice guide"", and suggests therapeutic approximation strategies, including early detection, reference.
166	Introduction.
167	Sexually transmitted infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common bacterial infection in the world.
168	Although it may be asymptomatic in most cases, C. trachomatis may cause a variety of reproductive health problems in women, including cervicitis, Darfur and salpmeningitis.
169	Despite its importance, Medellín does not have sufficient epidemiological data on this infection.
170	Objective.
171	Determine the prevalence of C. trachomatis in women in Medellín, identify possible risk factors and assess the relationship with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection.
172	Materials and methods.
173	A multi-centre cross study was conducted to detect C. trachomatis infection in 1,282 women by conventional PCR and LightMix 480 HT CT / NG (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
174	The results were as follows:
175	The total prevalence of C. trachomatis infection was 4.1 per cent (95% CI 2.9-5.3).
176	A significant relationship was found between infection and age, cigarette smoking and the use of hormonal contraceptives.
177	In this regard, it is necessary to ensure that the right to health is respected.
178	The prevalence of infection is similar to that reported elsewhere in the country and around the world, with younger women most affected.
179	Regarding the presentation of the HPV, no relationship was found with C. trachomatis.
180	Nursing homes are high-risk environments for the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, as they are closed environments, with atypical manifestations of the disease, with high potential for unfavorable mobility and staff.
181	On the other hand, in a pandemic situation, many hospitals have endured periods of great care pressure.
182	The objective of this work was to present an experience of medicalization in a residence where almost 50% of residents contracted the disease.
183	A multidisciplinary intervention was carried out in a public residential home for elders with 99 residents.
184	Specialists of internal medicine, primary care and health technicians worked together in close cooperation with the workers of the residence.
185	The presence of nursing staff was authorized on a 24-hour basis and medical staff on a daily visit.
186	The center was provided with the necessary resources for the administration of medication (oral and intravenous) and oxygen therapy for patients with the disease.
187	The analytical results were available in 24 hours.
188	For data analysis, percentages were calculated and the average was used as a measure of central trend.
189	Forty-eight residents (48.5 per cent) and fifteen workers contracted the disease.
190	The total number of deaths during this period was 13 (13.1 per cent), 7 of them with diagnosis of HIVAIDS (average age 84.4 years), with a case fatality rate of 14.6 per cent.
191	Eleven patients (22%) with a diagnosis of AIDS-19 were hospitalized, and two died on admission.
192	Medicalization of residential care can help to reduce the pressure on hospital care and to optimize care for these vulnerable persons with more humane care, which can ultimately lead to better health outcomes.
193	To describe the academic and care activities of emergency graduates at the General Regional Hospital 25 of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS).
194	This is an observational, descriptive study, which analysed the 25 generations who have graduated from the speciality.
195	The scientific, teaching and assistance productivity of their graduates was analyzed, as were subsequent training and managerial positions.
196	From 1991 to 2018, 238 residents were admitted, of whom 88.65 per cent completed their studies.
197	A total of 57.34 per cent are male.
198	Some 78.67 per cent of graduates work exclusively in the Mexican Social Security Institute and 68.72 per cent work in more than one institution.
199	Seventy-two per cent are certified.
200	They published 112 scientific articles and 4 books.
201	12.32 per cent of graduates received a second degree, the predominant being that of critical patient care (84.61 per cent).
202	The main achievements of headquarters include being the country 's first emergency headquarters to be included in the National Science and Technology Council' s Quality Graduate Programme.
203	Fifty-three per cent of these specialists are or have served in managerial positions.
204	This headquarters is a reference point within the emergency field in Latin America.
205	Introduction: To combat the HIV / AIDS pandemic, Governments have adopted measures such as quarantine and social alienation.
206	Objective: The main objective of this study was to analyze the impact of quarantine by COVID-19 on body mass in combat sports athletes.
207	Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, prospective and multi-centre study that assessed 234 men (average age and standard deviation, 29 ± 10 years) residing in Argentina (n = 38);
208	Bolivia (n = 1); Brazil (n = 105);
209	Chile (n = 30); El Salvador (n = 1);
210	Spain (n = 22); Mexico (n = 22) and Peru (n = 15).
211	Of these, 12 were engaged in Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ), 54 boxing, 67 judo, 13 karate, 52 kick boxing and muay thai (KmarekMA), 27
212	An online survey was developed using Google Forms.
213	It was implemented between 4 and 17 April 2020.
214	Athletes were asked about their body mass before beginning quarantine and after 20 ± 5 days of quarantine.
215	Results: Athletes in all combat sports were heavier during quarantine than during pre-quarantine (p < 0.001, d = 0.12).
216	Conclusions: Combat sports athletes showed a higher body mass during quarantine because of the COVID-19.
217	To provide an overview of morbidity and mortality due to acute diarrhoeal disease (ADD) in Mexico between 2000 and 2016 in order to understand its magnitude, distribution and evolution.
218	Longitudinal ecological study with secondary sources of information.
219	Data on epidemiological surveillance, service provision and vital statistics were analyzed.
220	Service utilization and mortality rates were calculated.
221	Morbidity from EDA decreased by 42.1% in the period, but emergency care increased by 50.7% in SS.
222	The hospitalization rate dropped by 37.6 per cent and mortality by 39.7 per cent in the general population and 72.3 per cent in children under five.
223	Chiapas and Oaxaca were the states with the highest mortality rate.
224	Cases of diarrhea, including rotavirus, have decreased in the country.
225	However, in 2016, a rate of 3.4 per 100,000 people who die from EDA was found, which could be avoided by health promotion.
226	Evaluate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of oral spray cannabinoids as complementary therapy for children with spasticity due to cerebral palsy or traumatic injury of the central nervous system who do not respond to conventional treatment.
227	METHOD: A total of 72 patients (average [SD] age 12 years 4 months [3 years 1 month], range 8-18 years) were randomized to 2: 1 to receive nabiximol spray for men (n = 47);
228	The primary result was a change in the baseline level of spasticity in a Numeric Qualification Scale (NRS) from 0 to 10, assessed by the primary caregiver at 12 weeks.
229	Secondary outcomes included additional measures for spasticity, sleep quality, pain, health-related quality of life, comfort, depression and safety.
230	There were no significant differences in the range of NRS 0-10 between the nabiximol versus the placebo group after 12 weeks.
231	No statistically significant differences were observed for any secondary valuation criteria.
232	The adverse events were predominantly mild or moderate in severity; however, three cases of hallucinations were reported.
233	INTERPRETATION: Nabiximol was generally well tolerated; however, neuropsychiatric adverse events were observed.
234	No significant reduction in spasticity was observed with treatment with nabiximols versus placebo.
235	The results of compulsory confinement have been detrimental in several respects.
236	However, they have had an impact on reducing the number of active cases of HIVAIDS.
237	Chile had begun to deescalate and needed to know the best time to end the restrictions.
238	Discuss the best conditions and guarantees for the end of compulsory confinement based on new cases, active cases and positive PCR tests.
239	Study based on a trend model with estimates of predictions.
240	Data on the variables of interest were subjected to linear regression studies to determine the curve that best explained the data.
241	The determination coefficient, the standard deviation of and x and the confidence interval of the observed curve were estimated.
242	The trend curve was then chosen in line with the regression estimates.
243	It was found that all dependent variables tended to decrease over time in a quadratic way, with the exception of the variable new cases.
244	Estimates of coefficient of determination (R < sup > 2 < / sup >) and average absolute percentage error are generally satisfactory, except for the variable: Number of polymerase chain reaction tests per day.
245	Step-by-step and precautionary measures must be taken before compulsory confinement is terminated.
246	In the current de-escalation, the daily polymerase chain reaction examinations should be increased and monitoring should be maintained on the incidence, prevalence and positive indicators of such tests.
247	The evidence suggests with some degree of reliability that compulsory confinement could be safely lifted from 30 August 2020.
248	Long-term preparations must be made to contain the future waves, that is, a new increase in new and active cases following the downturn.
249	When an outbreak occurs, in the vast majority of cases a variety of misconceptions begin to emerge without an epidemiologist, who will know what to do and how to do it.
250	Should the outbreak become uncontrolled, support staff will be required.
251	For this reason, a rapid deployment team must be established to investigate outbreaks and to coordinate and advise those responsible for medical care and limit local epidemiological surveillance.
252	The objective of this study was to validate the Brazilian version of the Disturbance of Sleep-Items Banks of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS).
253	The validation of these item banks was carried out using classical test theory, item response theory, item calibration, according to Samejima 's proposed step-by-step response model, and differential item functioning analysis.
254	In relation to the quality of the data, it was observed that there were no lost data and five items from the Disturbed sleep bank and four items from the Disturbed Vigilia bank had floor effects, and none of the banks had a ceiling effect.
255	Both banks showed excellent reliability on a homogeneous scale and good temporal stability.
256	Confirmatory factor analysis, using absolute and incremental adjustment quality indices, showed a good adjustment for the two banks, which shows that the instruments are valid and sufficiently one-dimensional.
257	The calibration showed that the psychometric properties of the items were satisfactory with good coverage of the sleep-wake construct.
258	As far as DIF is concerned, both the Disturbed sleep bank and the Vigilia Disturb showed to be homogeneous for the different groups tested.
259	It can be concluded that the Portuguese-speaking Brazilian version of the Distorbian and Dry Items Banks of the PROMIS Probation proved to be reliable, accurate and valid, with psychometric analysis.
260	In 1987, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a simplified Trace Classification System.
261	This system was designed for use by non-specialist community staff and includes five signs, each of which may be present or absent in the eyes: (I) trachomatous trichosis; (iii) corneal trachosis;
262	Although not perfectly sensitive or very specific to the trachoma, these signs have been essential tools for identifying populations that require interventions to eliminate the trachoma as a public health problem.
263	In 2018, the definition of one of the signs, trachomatous trichiasis, was changed at the WHO Fourth World Science Meeting on Trachoma to rule out trichiasis involving only the lower eyelid.
264	This document describes the modified system, updates its presentation, provides comments on its implementation and identifies areas of ongoing discussion.
265	The rationale for the study was to assess the degree of knowledge of Spanish pharmacists in the field of drug surveillance, their reporting of adverse reactions to drugs (ADRs) and their need for training, establishing differences between community pharmacists in hospitals and community pharmacists in hospitals.
266	A questionnaire containing 12 questions on drug surveillance was designed.
267	The questionnaires were distributed and collected online with the collaboration of the Official Pharmacists Colleges and the Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy, during the period from November 2018 to June 2019.The target population
268	The results were processed through a descriptive and analytical analysis.
269	Qualitative variables were presented with their frequency distribution and quantitative variables with their average and standard deviation.
270	Ninety-nine per cent of the FH reported having had an ADR and 96.9 per cent reported it.
271	Of the CPCs, 73.5 per cent reported that they had an ADR but only 48.7 per cent confirmed that they reported it.
272	Respondent pharmacists generally agreed on the importance of drug surveillance, and believed that treatment quality could be improved and savings in the Spanish health system would be achieved through greater application of drug surveillance.
273	Our results indicate that FH reports more of an ADR than the FC.
274	It is also the FH that have the best knowledge of their obligations to drug surveillance.
275	Respondent pharmacists believe that the development of pharmaco-surveillance activities would increase professionals' adherence to notification and would lead to improvements in treatment quality, rational drug use and patient safety.
276	In Uganda, one in five children have mental health problems, including disruptive behavior disorders (CDDs).
277	TCD can continue into adulthood and have negative consequences.
278	Effective interventions for TCDs have been developed and evaluated in communities with high poverty rates in developed countries.
279	However, most African countries, such as Uganda, lack such interventions.
280	This article describes the process of adapting a United States-led factual intervention to optimize its adaptation to the context with intervention fidelity as part of a random trial of behavioural problems young people and their caregivers in 30 schools in Uganda.
281	The process consisted of initial meetings with principals and teachers to present the study and main concepts of the intervention; an initial review of the handbook focusing on the contents of the 4Rs and 2 Ss intervention by the Ugandan team;
282	This article describes both the similarities and the differences between the content of the original and the adapted intervention and the methods of implementation.
283	The results also highlight the importance of involving stakeholders in the adaptation process.
284	The HIV / AIDS pandemic has disrupted routine hospital services worldwide.
285	This study estimated the total number of elective operations for adults to be cancelled worldwide during the 12-week maximum interruption due to COVID "".19
286	METHODS: A comprehensive expert response study was conducted to provide projections of the proportion of elective surgery to be cancelled or postponed for 12 weeks of the maximum disruption peak.
287	A Bayesian beta regression model was used to estimate cancellation rates for 12 weeks in 190 countries.
288	Data from cases of elective surgical cases, stratified by specialty and indication (cancer versus benign surgery), were determined.
289	This case mix was applied to surgical volumes at the country level.
290	The 12-week cancellation rates were applied to these figures to calculate the total number of suspended operations.
291	The best estimate was for 28,404,603 operations to have been cancelled or postponed for 12 weeks of the disruption peak by COVID-19 (2,367,050 operations per week).
292	Most of the operations were for benign diseases (90.2 per cent, 25,638,922 / 28. 404. 603).
293	The overall cancellation rate in 12 weeks would be 72.3 per cent.
294	At the global level, 81.7 per cent (25,638,921 / 31,378,062) of benign surgery, 37.7 per cent (2,324,069 / 6,162,311) of cancer surgery had been cancelled.
295	If countries increase their normal surgical volume by 20 per cent after the pandemic, it would take a median of 45 weeks to eliminate the backlog of operations resulting from disruption by COVID "".19
296	CONCLUSION: A very large number of operations will be cancelled or postponed due to the disruption caused by COVID-19.
297	Governments should mitigate this important burden on patients by developing recovery plans and implementing strategies to safely restart surgical activity.
298	To identify the period of time during which a hospital bed is virtually available on the computer system, while occupied by a patient, in a hospital in Mexico.
299	A cross-sectional study was conducted in a 250 bed academic medical centre in north-central Mexico in February 2015.
300	The administrative and actual discharge of the patient was recorded in an institutional format.
301	Central trend measures were used to present the data.
302	The cost of the day / bed was obtained from the official data published for the nation; 943 patients were followed up during the discharge process.
303	2.4% of the total number of beds were occupied by discharged patients.
304	The annual cost for cold / dead beds was $959,220.00 ($14,348,304.00 MNX), without benefit to patients.
305	Cold / dead beds accounted for 1.31 per cent of the annual hospital budget in 2015.
306	It is necessary to implement improvement initiatives to allocate beds efficiently to patients.
307	The discharge process should be standardized to reduce direct hospital costs per day / bed.
308	The supervision of resident doctors involved in this process must be strengthened.
309	The COVID-19 pandemic begins on 31 December 2019 in China and SARS-CoV-2 is identified as the causative agent.
310	The objective of this original work is to describe the spatial and temporal dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in the first 100 days of the epidemic in Pernambuco State, Brazil.
311	We present the evolution of cases and deaths according to epidemiological weeks.
312	We carried out the analysis of the series of the cumulative confirmed caseload of COVID-19, with projections for the next 15 days, using the JoinPoint application.
313	This programme makes it possible to identify turning points, proving their statistical significance.
314	We also analyze the trend of awareness of COVID-19 in the State, considering the percentage distribution of cases in Recife, municipalities of the Recife Metropolitan Region and the interior, by sets of three weeks' maps.
315	The 100 days of the COVID-19 epidemic resulted in 52,213 cases and 4,235 deaths between 12 March, corresponding to epidemiological week 11, until June 20, 2020 (epidemiological week 25).
316	The peak of the epidemic curve occurred in epidemiological week 21 (23 May), followed by a slowdown in the number of cases.
317	The periphery of cases in the capital and metropolitan region was initially detected, followed by rapid dissemination to the interior of the State.
318	There was a reduction in average daily growth rates from April, but with an average level of over 6,000 cases per week of COVID-19.
319	At the end of the period, the State case series indicates the persistence of community circulation and transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
320	Finally, it is questionable, to paraphrase García Márquez in a hundred years of solitude, whether we are dealing with ""a period of referral or the prelude to an upsurge"".
321	In this article we analyze the effect of the emigration of South African families on parents / grandparents who must renegotiate their lives in the face of the physical absence of their loved ones.
322	We take a transnational perspective in a larger qualitative project to take account of both sides of the migration spectrum.
323	Here we focus on elderly family members who remain, a largely abandoned group in previous investigations.
324	Our findings illustrate the complex emotions and relational changes experienced by elderly people whose families migrate.
325	New technologies bridge and narrow distances, allowing new ways to connect, care for each other and reinvent transnational relations and what constitutes family life, but these bridges cannot reverse the loss suffered.
326	People have to give meaning to emigration and forge new relationships with the remaining family members.
327	Our findings accentuate the significant role of grandparents in a family system and highlight some gender and race differences in family experiences.
328	Previous research indicates that couples facing a chronic disease from a ""we"" relational orientation have more positive results than individual couples; however, there is little prior research to identify the clinical processes involved.
329	This grounded theory analysis of 25 video therapy sessions with six heterosexual couples facing a chronic liver disease used a feministically based relational perspective to focus on clinical processes related to the transition from individual orientation.
330	The findings identified three contextual obstacles to ""evidence-based orientation"": (A) autonomy discourse, (b) disease-related power, and (c) power associated with gender.
331	The analysis detailed the therapist's measures that reduced the impact of obstacles to reciprocity and encouraged relational coping.
332	Clinical implications address the complex intersections between gender, care and contextual obstacles to reciprocity.
333	Determine the additional diagnostic yield of a rapid serology test that detects IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in relation to real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (rPCR).
334	A cross sectional study was carried out including patients hospitalized by COVID-19 in three hospitals, health workers exposed to infection and outpatients who met suspected case criteria, who underwent the molecular test (PCR) and the rapid test.
335	The additional diagnostic yield of rapid serology tests in relation to molecular tests was assessed.
336	The sensitivity and specificity of these tests were also estimated.
337	A total of 144 persons were included.
338	The rapid serological test achieved 19.4 per cent of positive results compared to 11.1 per cent in the molecular test (p = 0.03).
339	The rapid serology test detected 21 cases that had been negative by the initial PCR and the additional diagnostic yield was 56.8 per cent compared to the RTK.
340	Additional diagnostic performance was 50.0 per cent during the first week, 70.0 per cent during the second week and 50.0 per cent during the third week of symptoms onset.
341	The sensitivity of the rapid serological test was 43.8 per cent and the specificity was 98.9 per cent.
342	The rapid serology test was able to detect more cases than the molecular test, especially from the second week of onset of symptoms.
343	It was also highly specific.
344	The results would be useful as a complementary test to the molecular test, especially during the second and third week of the disease.
345	A circumferential resection marginin (CRM) margin of 1.0 mm after rectal cancer surgery is believed to increase the risk of local recurrence (LR).
346	This population-based retrospective study assessed how the distance from the MRC affected the risk of AR.
347	METHODS: Data from the Swedish Register of Colorectal Cancer (SCRCR) were used for retrospective analysis of rectal cancers resected between 2005 and 2013.
348	The primary objective was the RA.
349	A total of 12,146 patients were identified, with 8,666 patients analyzed after the exclusions.
350	A total of 739 patients had MRC of ≤ 1.0 mm and 7,653 patients MRC of > 1.0 mm.
351	The average follow-up time was 51 months.
352	There were 66 (8.9%) cases of LR in MRC group ≤ 1.0 mm and 256 (3.3%) cases of LR in the MRC group > 1.0 mm.
353	RA rate was 17% (n = 27 / 159), 6.7% (n = 39 / 580), 1.9% (n = 2 / 103) and 3.4% (n = 254 / 7550) for CRM
354	The R & R risk of 0.0 mm was higher compared to all other groups with larger MRC (P < 0.05).
355	No difference in AR between 1.1-1.9 mm and ≥ 2 mm was observed.
356	The LR was diagnosed earlier when the MRC was ≤ 1.0 mm.
357	CONCLUSION: The risk of AR is related to the exact CRM, with a higher risk in patients with CRM of 0.0 mm.
358	Close monitoring of patients without a clear measurable margin can allow early detection of AR.
359	HIV patients are more likely to develop cancer.
360	Malignant lymphomas are the main cancer group observed in these patients.
361	Diffuse large B cell lymphoma, including central nervous system and Burkitt 's lymphoma, account for 90% of all 22 year old NHL, with fever up to 39 ° C, malaise
362	Haemoglobin of 9.5 g / dl, leukocytes 5.13 x 103 / mm, platelets 124 000 cells / mm / mm / mm / mm; albumin 2.9 g / dl; alanine aminotransferase 28 IU / L, aspartate aminotransferase 105 IU / L;
363	HIV reactive, beta 2 microglobulin 20 000 ng / ml. Viral load for HIV 100 034 cp / ml, CD4 76 cell / mcL (5%).
364	The abdominal ultrasound showed cysts in the liver and spleen.
365	Abdominopelvic tomography found hepatosplenomegaly, retroperitoneal and inguinal adenopathies and free fluid in the abdominal cavity.
366	Splenectomy was performed and the histopathologic study reported Burkitt 's lymphoma.
367	HIV predisposes patients to any type of cancer.
368	Intra-abdominal findings should lead to suspicion of lymphoma and may occur from infiltration of the small intestine, solid organ and soft tissues.
369	Under the Global Health Strategy against Viral Hepatitis C and the Strategic Plan to Address Hepatitis C in the National Health System (SNS), the Secretariat of the National Plan for HIV / AIDS
370	This article describes the experience and reflections that have been gained around it.
371	Key points in the process include interdisciplinary work through a Technical Group involving experts from the different areas involved; availability of scientific evidence for decision-making, especially the 2nd Comprehensive HCV Seroprevalence Study.
372	The result is shown in the newly published HVC Screening Guide, which indicates screening of persons with exposures and risk situations for infection, as well as main recommendations for improved screening and treatment.
373	We hope that this Guide and the continuation of joint work will boost equitable access to the diagnosis and treatment of HCV infection in Spain.
374	Introduction: Evidence suggests a role of vitamin A in the regulation of fat mass that affects obesity and cardiovascular diseases.
375	Material and methods: This is a cross-sectional study of 200 women matched by age and dietary intake of vitamin A.
376	They were divided into four groups according to body mass index (BMI): 80 eutrophic (E), 40 overweight (OW), 40 obese class I (OI) and 40 obese class II (OI).
377	Liquid and glucose profiles were measured and oxidative stress was assessed through serum concentrations of uric acid, glutathione-peroxide (GSH-Px) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS).
378	Results: The cut-off points for the deficiency in serum concentrations of retinol and carotene were 1.05 µmol / L and 40 g / dl, respectively.
379	The recommended dietary intake of vitamin A was 700 g / day.
380	A deficiency of retinol and carotene was found in group E of 5% and 15%, respectively, reaching 77.5% and 82.5% in group OII.
381	Conclusions: There was a correlation between serum concentrations of retinol and carotene and glycemic, lipid and oxidative stress markers profiles in the groups studied.
382	It was observed that OI and OII subjects with retinol and carotene deficiency were 16 and 20.7 times more likely to be diagnosed with DM2 compared to E with adequate vitamin A concentrations.
383	Increased demand for vitamin A may be associated with increased BMI, body fat and oxidative stress, even when the recommended intake of vitamin A is achieved.
384	The association between physical activity and health has been clearly established, and the promotion of physical activity should be seen as a cost-effective approach universally prescribed as first-line treatment for almost all chronic diseases.
385	Health care providers involved in the care of persons with cerebral palsy (CP) are encouraged to play an active role in promoting their health and well-being.
386	Balancing activity behavior throughout the day, with improved physical activity, reduced sedentary time and healthy sleep behaviours, can prepare infants, pre-school and school age children with CP for a healthy lifespan.
387	However, most physicians do not apply a systematic monitoring, assessment and management approach to detecting problems with physical activity or sleep in children with CP.
388	As a result, many children with CP lose an important first line of treatment.
389	This article presents an evidence-based clinical practice guide with practical advice to help professionals identify 24-hour activity problems as a critical step towards adopting healthy lifestyle behaviours for long-term PC children.
390	The Kenya Constitution of 2010 brought about a series of reforms in all sectors to conform to new constitutional standards, including transmission and a comprehensive bill of rights.
391	The constitution provides a platform for promoting health rights and restructuring legal, institutional and regulatory frameworks to reverse chronic deficiencies and improve health outcomes.
392	These health reforms, established by constitutional mandate, are complex.
393	All areas of the health system are also being simultaneously transformed, with several new laws enacted and public health agencies established.
394	However, the lack of adequate tools and methods limited the implementation of these complex changes.
395	An adapted framework of the health system, guided by World Health Organization concepts and definitions, was developed to provide insight into the scope of health reforms in the first 10 years of the constitution.
396	In this context, the framework for documenting existing and enacted health laws and public agencies was implemented, comparing the degree of transformation before and after the 2010 Constitution.
397	The analysis revealed that multiple structures (laws and public enforcement agencies) were formed throughout the health system, with many new management structures aligned with transmission, but fragmented within the regulatory subfunction.
398	By dismantling the normative functions of the health system, the framework provided a comprehensive mapping of the various attributes of the health system (roles, laws and enforcement agencies).
399	The proposed framework is considered a useful tool for countries that wish to develop and implement a legal basis conducive to universal health coverage.
400	Constitutional reform is a mobilizing force for significant progress in institutional change in the health sector, fostering two aspects of the viability of change: Acceptance by stakeholders and authority to act.
401	Migrant populations are at increased risk of exposure to traumatic events in life.
402	Currently, there are no reliable and valid PTSD detection tools for Filipino migrant workers, a population of over 2.3 million worldwide.
403	This study assessed the psychometric properties of the DHS Check List 5 (PCL-5) in a sample of Filipino migrant workers in Macao (SAR), China, in two studies.
404	The first panel examined reliability (internal and test reassessment), convergent validity (with depression, anxiety and rumination) and discriminatory validity (with pain and social support) in a sample of 131 participants.
405	The second study established the criterion validity of the PCL-5 using the PTSD module of the International Neuropsychiatric Interview Mini (MINI) applied by a Philippine psychologist as a criterion, in a sample of 100 participants.
406	The results showed an excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.95) and a moderate reliability of 10 days of test-re-evaluation (0.58, p < 0.001).
407	PCL-5 scores were strongly correlated with scores on depression measures (0.71, p < 0.001), anxiety (0.61, p < 0.001) and rumination (0.68, supporting
408	Discriminatory validity was demonstrated by a weaker association with scores on pain measures
409	(C)
410	Effects of stimulant drug treatment on the patterns of Circadian activity in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
411	Introduction.
412	Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental disorders in childhood.
413	Nuclear symptoms of ADHD are treated with stimulants such as methylphenidate; however, there is much controversy about their side effects.
414	Objectives.
415	Analyse activity patterns in children with ADHD for 24 hours for 7 days, before and after stimulant drug treatment (methylphenidate), and observe differences between different presentations of the disorder (inatent combined subtype)
416	Patients and methods.
417	A total of 30 children and adolescents (newly diagnosed with ADHD according to the diagnostic criteria of the DSM IV) were assessed through an actygraph, a tool for monitoring body movements by analyzing movement patterns and differences between sleep.
418	The results were as follows:
419	Significant differences exist before and after treatment, with higher levels of activity in patients with ADHD before starting treatment and a decline in this activity following pharmacological treatment.
420	There are also differences between inattentive and combined sub-types, and the last group shows a higher level of activity.
421	In this regard, it is important to note that there is a lack of progress in this area.
422	The level of activation presented by individuals with ADHD is higher before treatment is taken, and affects Circumdian patterns, sleep and quality of life.
423	Drug treatment helps to reduce the level of activation.
424	Introduction: Some weight concerns have been observed among adolescent gymnasts, with insufficient energy diets and some nutrients in search of maximum yields.
425	This concern may be related to eating disorders, irregular menstruation, fatigue and insufficient rest.
426	Objectives: To assess the dietary and nutritional status, body composition, eating behavior and body image concerns of competitive gymnasts.
427	Methods: This was an observational and cross-country study involving 33 female gymnasts (age: M = 14.52, SD = 1.85), a sub-elite, aged 11-18.
428	Anthropometric assessments were made, a food attitudes test (EAT-26) and a body image questionnaire (BSQ) were applied and interviewed, collecting socio-demographic, socio-sports, health and health data.
429	Results: The diet of female athletes is mainly deficient in water, carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins D and E, fibre, iron and calcium, with vitamin A and sodium overintake.
430	Sportswomen have normal weight and high values of muscular mass, low fat mass and mean values of the components of the somatotype (balanced endomorph with a central tendency).
431	Two cases of risk of eating disorders (ED) and concern about perceived body image were detected in one quarter of the sample.
432	Conclusions: The risk of eating disorders is related to the consumption of prohibited drugs or addictive substances, irregular menstruation, tiredness and sleep less hours.
